# 8puzzle

This repository is a project from Princeton's Algorithms course. The assignment is focused on using a priority queue and comparators to solve the classic 8puzzle slider game using the priority queue data structure to simulate a pseudo artificial intelligence. The program generates new adjacent boards that are one move off of the current board and adds them to a priority queue if they are not already in it. The best board is then removed from the priority queue and its neighbors are examined; this cycle is repeated until the board is solved or is found to be unsolvable. The best board is defined as the board closest to the target/solved board using the Manhatten distance which is the distance of each tile from its solved position. Within the repository is the code for the project within the src folder as well as files for testing the program runs as intended.
